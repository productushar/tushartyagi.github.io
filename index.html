            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>With Indian ethnicity but an upbringing in the Middle East’s crown jewel - Dubai, I’ve grown up soaking both the humility and hustle characteristic of a developing economy like India and the grandeur and limitlessness of a country like the Emirates. To top it all off, I came to the United States for college in 2021 to discover what the "American Dream" even meant; And while it has significantly reshaped my worldview, I continue to learn and evolve every day.</p>
            <p>What’s fascinated me most about the States at least professionally so far, is its work culture. Whether at my research lab or student jobs, there’s a unique energy and approach to getting things done that I’ve noticed here, and I love it. And so at present, I’m looking to extend this experience further into the corporate world. I am open to and actively seeking full-time roles in Software Engineering, Product Management, or Tech Consulting (post-Dec 2024), but also any other opportunities that may align with my skill set!</p>
            <p>That said, I have a variety of interests beyond my formal education too, and so feel free to reach out about whatever, whenever.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the goal is to head back and take a risk towards something entrepreneurial. So if you have life advice or a potential opportunity to share, I’d also appreciate that.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your time, and have a great day!</p>
