            <p>I have always thoroughly enjoyed storytelling, and sharing my life's experiences/learnings.

                        <h3>In each lifetime, find your bike.</h3>
                        <p>For an event once at ASU, I was asked to tell a story on any topic of my choice. Out of everything, I decided to talk about my bikes. Here's that story.</p>

                        <p>I only have the audio for this one but here, I got to address all of ASU's (engineering) faculty, and student researchers during our semesterly research syposium on a neural signals project I had then been working on for roughly over a year. Also went over the impact that this research and ASU have had on my life!</p>

                        <p>After spending 1.5 years in college, I went back to school for a podcast on what to expect/how to prepare for when one finally makes that big move! This goes over changes I experienced during the transition, learnings, and how to go about university in the best way possible.</p>
